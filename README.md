# An Apex App

## Required

For the moment, to be abble to use this app, you have to install expo globally.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

You need a module to load and refresh automatically the back-end, i use nodemon.

You also need to have node and npm.

## Get started

```
https://github.com/AsyVasy/react-native-app.git
```

For the front-end:

```
cd react-native-app
npm install
```

for the back-end

```
cd react-native-app/back
npm install
nodemon server.js
```

Note that the back-end won't work without the database.
I will give an sql file later.

The apex-api-tracker won't work without a token. I can't give you mine but you will find one here [here](https://apex.tracker.gg/)
